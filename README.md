# Consul Imex (Import/Export) Tool

Consul-Imex is a simple import/export tool for [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) key/value storage over Consul HTTP API.

* Export all the keys in a prefix, save it as a json file.
* Import the keys from a json file to Consul under a specified prefix.
* Copy keys:
  - from a prefix to another prefix.
  - from a server to another server under a specified prefix.
* Compare two sources and export keys different from second source's keys

## Installation

You can install Consul Imex in several ways:

* Executable phar file (requires PHP >=5.5.9)
* Docker image (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) engine)
* Composer dependency (requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and PHP >=5.5.9)
* Single PHP project (requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and PHP >=5.5.9)

### Install as an executable phar file

Download the phar file from `https://github.com/gamegos/consul-imex/releases/download/1.0.0-rc1/consul-imex.phar`, then assign execute permission for it. 

Example:

    wget -O /usr/local/bin/consul-imex https://github.com/gamegos/consul-imex/releases/download/1.0.0-rc1/consul-imex.phar
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/consul-imex

### Install as a docker image

    docker pull sozpinar/consul-imex

### Install as a Composer dependency

    composer require gamegos/consul-imex

### Install as a PHP project

Install via `composer`:

    composer create-project gamegos/consul-imex

Or clone/download and install manually:

    git clone https://github.com/gamegos/consul-imex.git
    cd consul-imex
    composer install

## Notices for Docker Usage

### Docker parameters

- **[--rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm)**: Run once then clean up
- **[\`pwd\`:/consul-imex](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/##volume-shared-filesystems)**: Mount a host directory to the container
- **[-u \`id -u\`:\`id -g\`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#user)**: Set current user and group id to the container
- **[--net=host](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings)**: Share the hostâ€™s network stack and all interfaces with container
- **[-it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground)**: Make container interactive

### Input/Output File Location

To use `import` and `export` commands with docker, the input/output files must be accessible by the container. The default working directory of the image is `/consul-imex` and input/output files are placed under this directory by default.

#### Examples for `export` command:

**Example 1:** Mount a host directory to the container for `export` operation, then the container will create `my-data.json` file in the host directory.

    $ docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/consul-imex -u `id -u`:`id -g` sozpinar/consul-imex export -u 192.168.1.20:8500 -p /foo/bar my-data.json
    93 keys are fetched.

**Example 2:** Copy the output file to your working directory after `export` operation.

    $ docker run -it sozpinar/consul-imex export -u 192.168.1.20:8500 -p /foo/bar my-data.json
    93 keys are fetched.
    $ docker cp `docker ps -ql`:/consul-imex/my-data.json .

#### Examples for `import` command:

**Example 1:** Mount a host directory to the container for `import` operation, then the container will read `my-data.json` file from the host directory.

    $ docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/consul-imex sozpinar/consul-imex import -u 192.168.1.20:8500 -p /new/prefix my-data.json
    93 keys are stored. (25 new directories are created.)

**Example 2:** Mount a file to the container and use it for `import` operation. This method does not require the input file to be placed in the default working directory.

    $ docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`/my-data.json:/my-data.json sozpinar/consul-imex import -u 192.168.1.20:8500 -p /new/prefix -v /my-data.json
    93 keys are stored. (25 new directories are created.)

### Network Configuration

If your Consul service is in a private network or does not have a public URL, you may have to set up a custom network configuration for the docker container.

#### Example

    docker run --rm -it --net=host sozpinar/consul-imex copy -s http://localhost:8500 -t http://anotherhost:8500

If the default docker network type is `bridge` then the running container does not recognize 'localhost'. So we simply add `--net=host` argument to make the container to use the network of the host machine.

## Known Issues

### Directories with values

Consul key/value storage allows a directory to have a value like an ordinary key.
If a directory has a value, Consul Imex will ignore the value or the sub-keys;
this depends how the keys are ordered.
